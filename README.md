Chrome extension to browse Massdrop without an account

First Chrome extension. Pleasently pleased with how easy it was.

I'll probably throw this up on the Chrome store later, but for now you can add it yourself.

Nothing special: checks if mode=guest_open is on any Massdrop urls you visit, adds and reloads if it's not.

- Open up the extensions page (chrome://extensions/)
- If it's not already checked, hit the 'Developer Mode' box
- Load this repo's archive as an unpacked extension. 
- You should be good to go!
- If not, check out [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
